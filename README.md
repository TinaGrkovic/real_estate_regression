# 🏡 Real Estate Regression Project

## 📊 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to analyze the factors influencing real estate prices and to predict the selling prices of future homes. The goal is to help a local real estate investor make **data-driven decisions** for buying, selling, and renovating properties.

**Key Objectives:**
- Identify key variables impacting home sale prices.
- Provide actionable recommendations for real estate investment decisions.

## 📌 **Key Highlights**
- 🏠 **Data-Driven Decisions:** Built a robust regression model with 83% R² (adjusted) to predict home prices.
- 📈 **Top Price Drivers Identified:**
  - ✅ **Central Air Conditioning** → Increases price by up to 13.01%
  - ✅ **Garage Spaces** → Adds up to 8.68% value
  - ❌ **Non-Excellent Kitchens** → Decreases price by up to 22.73%
- 📊 **Data Preparation:** Handled missing values, created dummy variables for categorical data, and transformed skewed variables.
